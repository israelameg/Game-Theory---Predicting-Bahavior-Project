# Game-Theory-Predicting-Bahavior-Project
The project was made for "Human-Agent Interaction" course.

## Introduction
The project checks if we can predict human bahavior in take-some and give-some games. 
Our conclusions rely on data from the article: "An exploration of the motivational basis of take-some and give-some games".
We used machine learning methods on this data to check if we can predict human bahavior in games based on prior choises.
